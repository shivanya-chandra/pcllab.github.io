# Recommendation Letters

### Eligibility and Timeline

I will write a recommendation letter for students who have worked the lab for at least two semesters. I may agree to write a letter for students who have worked with us for less time. However, if you have not worked with us for long, I won't have much to say in a letter, which is why I typically only write letters for students who have worked with us for at least two semesters.

You need to request a recommendation letter **two months** prior to your first due date. Many graduate school applications are due December 1. That means you need to have requested your letter before **October 1**. Many job applications are due October 1 (some even earlier). That means you need to have talked with me about a letter before **August 1**.

### Confidentiality

Because I consider letters of recommendation to be confidential documents, I would like you to waive your right to view the letter (there should be a box you check to do that when you apply). This has nothing to do with the content of your letter – it is my preference because of the confidentiality of recommendation letters.
